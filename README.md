# Project 10 Python Tic-Tac-Toe

This is project called Tic-Tac-Toe.

This game is based on terminal

This game is made for two players at a same computer

To assign positions of the markers i have made this on the basis of numpad

I have used the os module to clear the output screen

The program is very simple go through it and you will understand it.

Added docstring and comments wherever it is necessary.
